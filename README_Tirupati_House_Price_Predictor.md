## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Data Collection:**  
   - House data collected from MagicBricks and other online sources.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values, removed outliers, and encoded categorical variables.

3. **Model Development:**  
   - Used Linear Regression and evaluated using R² Score (0.73).

4. **Web Application:**  
   - Built with Streamlit to collect input from users and return price predictions.

5. **Deployment:**  
   - Hosted using Streamlit Cloud for real-time access and testing.
